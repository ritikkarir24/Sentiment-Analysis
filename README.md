Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Suite, where text meets emotion, and data reveals insights!

## About The Project

### Conclusion

- Upon careful analysis of customer feedback, it can be seen that the second hypothesis stands validated. Reviews with lower ratings, characterized by a mismatch between the product features and customer expectations, are predominantly inconsistent with the quality of the product. In fact, this does not necessarily mean that the product quality was inferior. 

- Further, a detailed sentiment analysis of the 20 reviews categorized as negative reveals a uniform feeling of dissatisfaction. The uniform sentiment of unhappiness, experienced by all the reviewers, shows a complete absence of customer satisfaction for the products in question.
